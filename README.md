# asteroids-sdl3
This is trash, spaghetti code, so there's no point in looking into it. I really just made this repository incase I blow up my computer or something.

I used Arch Linux to compile this project, and I dynamically linked with SDL3 using the [sdl3 3.2.20-1](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/sdl3/) package.
